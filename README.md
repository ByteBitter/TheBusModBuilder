This tool allows you to build any mods you created inside the The Bus Modding Editor. It also enables you to use multible build versions (like 'stable' or 'beta')


## Requirements

You need the [The Bus Modding Editor](https://store.epicgames.com/de/p/the-bus-modding-editor) installed on your PC.

When using the tool for the first time, you need to configure at least one "Version":

1. Switch to the "Configuration" tab and click on "Add version"

2. Enter a Name for the version - this can be anything you want ('stable', 'beta', ...)

3. After entering the name, the tool will open a folder selection dialog - now navigate to the root folder of your modding editor installation and click "select folder", for me it is: `V:\Epic\TheBusModdingEditor`

4. Now you should see the config in the "Configuration" tab and there should be a `mod_config.json` file inside the folder where the tool is stored

## How to use the tool
