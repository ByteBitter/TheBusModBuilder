## DISCLAIMER - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

This software was made with my last 3 braincells and a little help of ChatGPT...

**Use at your own risk** â€” if anything goes wrong, I am not responsible. Your computer, your problem. Happy Modding!

This tool allows you to build any mods you created inside the The Bus Modding Editor. It also enables you to use multible build versions (like 'stable' or 'beta')
